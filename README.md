# Space-Shooter
A 2D space shooter in which the player has to destroy enemies spawning from the top of the screen using lasers.Â 

It includes a main menu with help and close options, a Best Score System, three powers-ups (Shield, Speed, and Triple Shot), enemy lasers, Pause Menu and the wrapping of the player from all sides.

It has animations for explosions, turning and losing a life.
It has music and other sound effects for shooting and explosions.

For the player, enemy, power ups, and their animations, I used a variety of sprites.
